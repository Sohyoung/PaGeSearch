# PaGeSearch (Pathway Genome Search)
## A Tool for Identifying Genes within Pathways in Unannotated Genomes

PaGeSearch can identify a list of genes or genes in a pathway efficiently from the genome without any annotation information.
PaGeSearch combines sequence similarity search, gene prediction, and neural network models to identify the most possible orthologs of the genes in the list of pathway.
